# 🚀 Pawa IT Assessment – Technical Product Manager (AI Products)

Assessment submission for **Pawa IT** Technical Product Manager (AI Products) role by **Samuel Nduati**.  

This repository contains my full evaluation of NM’s AI Q&A application (Next.js + FastAPI + Gemini API).  
The goal was to assess **code quality, production readiness, scalability, and product alignment** from both  
a technical and product management perspective.

## 📊 High-Level Summary

- **Code Quality:** Frontend (8/10) shows strong TypeScript/Next.js skills with professional UI/UX.  
  Backend (6.5/10) demonstrates solid FastAPI integration but lacks robust error handling and security.  

- **Production Readiness:** Core functionality works, but system is not deployable to enterprise scale without  
  addressing **security, monitoring, and scaling** gaps.  

- **Product Perspective:**  
  1. **Security & Compliance** – High priority (secrets management, auth, input validation, audit logging).  
  2. **Monitoring & Reliability** – High priority (logging, error tracking, health checks, CI/CD).  
  3. **Scalability & Performance** – Medium priority (database, caching, async processing, auto-scaling).  

- **Developer Feedback:** NM has excellent frontend skills and strong fundamentals. Needs guidance on  
  production-grade practices (security, error handling, monitoring).
