## ⚠️ Important Notice

The repository link provided (`https://github.com/NMmwangemi/llm-app`) is currently **inaccessible** and cannot be cloned or reviewed.  
This may be due to the repository being private, deleted, or incorrectly shared.  

As a result, **all evaluation fields below have been marked as N/A**.  
The structure of this assessment has been completed according to the required evaluation framework and can be updated immediately once repository access is restored.

## ✅ Guidance for Next Steps

To ensure this candidate’s work can be fairly and consistently evaluated, the following actions are required:  

1. **Repository Access:** Confirm that the repository link is correct. If the repository is private, NM should grant access rights to the evaluation team (either by making it public or adding evaluators as collaborators).  
2. **Access Deadline:** NM should be instructed to correct access permissions and re-share the repository within **48 hours**. This ensures the evaluation process remains on schedule.  
3. **Evaluation Continuation:** Once access is restored, this assessment document will be updated with actual findings and submitted for final review. Until then, all technical and product feedback remains pending.
