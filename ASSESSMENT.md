- **500 users:** Frequent API rate limit errors, server crashes
- **1000+ users:** Complete service failure, data loss

### Required Scaling Solutions:

**Immediate (0-100 users):**
- Implement connection pooling and async request queuing
- Add Redis for session management and caching
- Upgrade to Gemini API paid tier with higher limits

**Short-term (100-500 users):**
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes) with auto-scaling
- Load balancer with multiple backend instances
- Database cluster (PostgreSQL with read replicas)
- CDN implementation (CloudFront/Cloudflare)

**Long-term (500+ users):**
- Microservices architecture (separate LLM service)
- Message queue system (RabbitMQ/AWS SQS)
- Geographic distribution (multi-region deployment)
- Advanced caching strategies (Redis Cluster)

- **Cost Optimisation:** LLM API Efficiency

### Current Cost Drivers:
- **No Caching:** Identical questions trigger new API calls
- **No Optimization:** Long context windows for every request
- **No Throttling:** Users can spam expensive requests
- **No Model Selection:** Using expensive models for simple queries

### Cost Reduction Strategies:

**1. Smart Caching (60-80% cost reduction):**
```python
def get_cached_response(question):
    # Check for exact matches first
    exact_match = redis.get(f"exact:{hash(question)}")
    if exact_match:
        return exact_match

    # Check for semantic similarity (95%+ confidence)
    similar = vector_search.find_similar(question, threshold=0.95)
    if similar:
        return similar.response

    # No cache hit - make API call and cache result
    response = call_llm_api(question)
    cache_response(question, response)
    return response
```

**2. Tiered Model Strategy (30-50% cost reduction):**
```python
def select_optimal_model(question):
    complexity_score = analyze_complexity(question)

    if complexity_score < 3:
        return "gemini-1.5-flash"  # Cheaper for simple queries
    elif complexity_score < 7:
        return "gemini-1.5-pro"    # Standard model
    else:
        return "gemini-1.5-ultra"  # Premium for complex tasks
```

**3. Request Optimization (20-30% cost reduction):**
- Implement context length optimization
- Add request batching for multiple questions
- Smart prompt engineering to reduce token usage
